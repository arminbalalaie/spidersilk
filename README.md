Failify is a test framework for end-to-end testing of distributed systems. It can be used to deterministically inject failures during a normal test case execution. Currently, node failure, network partition, network delay, network packet loss, and clock drift is supported. For a few supported languages, it is possible to enforce a specific order between nodes in order to reproduce a specific time-sensitive scenario and inject failures before or after a specific method is called when a specific stack trace is present. For more information, please refer to the documentation
